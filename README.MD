## Introduction

GDPP (GDScript++) is a powerful tool that simplifies the process of transpiling Godot GDScript into C++. It's designed to enhance the performance and flexibility of your Godot projects by converting your scripts into C++ code, allowing for better optimization and integration with your game engine.

At its core, GDPP aims to provide an easy transition from GDScript to C++, making it an excellent choice for developers looking to boost their Godot projects' performance and extensibility.

## Features

- **Automatic Transpilation:** GDPP automates the process of transpiling GDScript into C++, making it a seamless transition.
- **Improved Performance:** C++ code execution is typically faster than GDScript, allowing for performance improvements in your Godot games.
- **Detailed Parser Stage:** GDPP is currently in the parser stage, where it's actively working on understanding GDScript code to facilitate accurate transpilation.

## Getting Started
